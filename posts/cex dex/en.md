# Introduction

If you have an interest in the world of cryptocurrencies, chances are you're already familiar with the concept of Decentralized Exchanges (DEX). Perhaps you're a user of centralized exchanges like Cronex, and you're either intrigued by the prospect of trading on DEX or looking to acquire a new DeFi coin not available on other centralized exchanges (CEX). Whatever your motivations, it's important to understand the fundamental differences between CEX and DEX in order to make an informed choice between them. Depending on your trading experience and goals, both these exchange types have their merits and drawbacks.
## Why Different Types of Exchanges Matter

For novice traders or those experienced solely in traditional finance, understanding the distinction between Centralized Exchanges (CEX) and Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) can be challenging. CEX operates on a similar logic to stock markets: a single organization manages the order book where market makers and takers place their orders. The order book then matches buyers' and sellers' requests, with a small fee being charged for each transaction.

Transactions on CEX occur through the order book and the exchange platform, contributing to the centralization of this model. To use CEX, such as Cronex, one needs to create an account and undergo personal verification procedures in accordance with local regulations. The exchange also handles the custody of assets, which traders deposit into their accounts for trading on CEX.

On the other hand, DEX are governed by smart contractsâ€”self-executing pieces of code on the blockchain. Separate organizations or projects can create their own DEX and manage them, but theoretically, DEX can operate autonomously through user participation in maintaining liquidity.

Unlike CEX, DEX typically do not employ order books for trading operations. Instead, decentralized exchanges operate on an Automated Market Maker (AMM) model. To use DEX, users simply require a cryptocurrency wallet and a specific amount of cryptocurrency (to cover gas/transaction fees). Due to their decentralized nature, DEX do not necessitate the creation of an account.

CEX provides newcomers with a user-friendly interface and an easier way to initiate trading. In case of issues, users can seek support. Conversely, DEX have their advantages, but they usually cater more to experienced users willing to sacrifice simplicity for decentralization.
