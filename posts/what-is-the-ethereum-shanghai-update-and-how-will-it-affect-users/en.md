title: "What is the Ethereum Shanghai update and how will it affect users?"
description: "Обновление Ethereum Shanghai (EIP-4895) позволит стейкерам ETH выводить свои активы из стейкинга и участвовать в качестве валидаторов на сети. С внедрением алгоритма Proof of Stake пользователям было разрешено стейкинг 32 ETH, блокируя эти средства на неопределенный срок и становясь валидаторами на сети. Это обновление, скорее всего, повлияет на долю ETH, находящуюся в стейкинге, относительно общего предложения, что, в свою очередь, может оказать влияние на динамику спроса и предложения ETH на рынке."

## Introduction
The Shanghai upgrade is highly anticipated by Ethereum stakers as it brings significant improvements to the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism in the network. This upgrade will also impact the demand for ETH in the market. Whether you are a long-term ETH holder, actively participating in staking, or considering purchasing this token, it's beneficial to understand how the Shanghai upgrade will affect your investment portfolio.

## Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade
In September 2022, Ethereum completed its transition to the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, abandoning the use of the Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm and mining for transaction processing. Users can now become validators in the network by staking 32 ETH instead of solving computational puzzles using specialized mining hardware. However, since this transition, stakers have not had the ability to withdraw their funds. The Shanghai upgrade (EIP-4895), scheduled for March 2023, introduces the feature to withdraw funds from staking, addressing this issue. Public testing of the upgrade is expected in late February 2023.

## What is Ethereum Staking?
Ethereum (ETH) staking is the process where ETH owners can temporarily lock up 32 ETH and become validators in the Ethereum network, which uses the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. In the PoS system, validators contribute to network security by verifying and confirming transactions, in return for which they receive rewards. With the Shanghai upgrade, stakers will be able to withdraw their locked funds, which was not possible after the launch of the Beacon Chain in December 2020.

## What is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)?
An Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) is an initiative to modify and enhance the Ethereum network. Anyone can create an EIP by submitting a proposal for consideration by the community and the developer council, filling out the relevant application. To get an EIP accepted and implemented, it needs approval for all the technical changes proposed within the initiative. Each EIP is also designated by a unique number, and the Shanghai upgrade is identified as EIP 4895.

## How Will the Ethereum Shanghai Update Affect Me?
The impact of the Ethereum Shanghai update will depend on your current situation. If you are involved in Ethereum staking, the update will allow you to withdraw your staked funds. However, it's important to note that not all stakers have staked 32 ETH directly; many have used liquid staking platforms for smaller amounts.

For traders interested in the price of ETH, the update can also have implications. The removal of withdrawal restrictions can affect liquidity and the overall supply of ETH. Other traders and investors will be monitoring the percentage of coins staked relative to the total supply. On the other hand, ETH staking may become more attractive due to improved liquidity, potentially increasing demand for ETH.

It's also essential to remember that the update can impact the price of native tokens on liquid staking platforms, as Ethereum stakers will have the ability to withdraw their funds directly, potentially reducing demand for alternative staking platforms.

Overall, the update will contribute to a more open market for ETH, where owners can react to supply and demand dynamics in the staking sphere, promoting market equilibrium and reducing artificial influence on ETH's price and turnover.

## In Conclusion
The Shanghai update introduces a crucial feature for Ethereum stakers and those planning to participate in staking. It's one of the long-awaited functions that complements the Proof of Stake mechanism following the Ethereum merge. The impact of the update on the market cannot be predicted, but all traders working with ETH should thoroughly study its specifics and changes.
